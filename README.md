# LockKeyIndicator
Developed this project for fun for my friends who use laptops which doesnt have Caps Lock indicator.

Most of ASUS and ACER mid range and budget laptops comes with no caps lock indicator.
So most people really annoy when typing on these laptops since this issue.

I am using a HP laptop, But I had to use my friend's laptops sometimes and this was a huge issue for me.
So I thought to develop this project.
**Its just few lines of code and 10 minutes of work, But this does the job very well :)**
